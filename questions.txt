Why free_area is an array of list_heads instead of a page_t
why does page_t contain list_heads

how does the program initialize? when do we need to declare new free_area[] lists?


proposed new structures

list_head {
    list_head prev, next;
    page_t page
}

page_t {
    int isAllocated
    int isSplit
}


finding index
once you get the page, should be able to find the index from doing size_t page_t -> p - (page_t*) g-pages; where p is obtained by doing list_entry()


g_memory represnets physical memory on the device, where each block is 4k....g pages maps to each 4k block in g_memory
