Why free_area is an array of list_heads instead of a page_t
why does page_t contain list_heads

how does the program initialize? when do we need to declare new free_area[] lists?


proposed new structures

list_head {
    list_head prev, next;
    page_t page
}

page_t {
    int isAllocated
    int isSplit
}
